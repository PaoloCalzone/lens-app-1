# 1. lens-app-1-testnet-nextjs

First iteration with the lens protocol on a nextjs app. Interaction with
the contracts on the Mumbai testnet, with the mocked whitelisted address
for Profile creations.

## notes:

- From the urql docs: "Create a new Client for every server-side rendered request. This ensures we reset the state for each rendered page."
